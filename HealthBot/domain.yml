  utter_diabetes_types:
  - text: |-
     There are a few different types of diabetes
     * Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About 10 percent of people with diabetes have this type.
     * Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin, and sugar builds up in your blood.
     * Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
     * Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes.
     * A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.
     Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments. [You know more about diabetes types From this link](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/types-of-diabetes)

  utter_diabetes_causes:
  - text: |-
      Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.

      * Type 1 diabetes
      Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

      Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.

      * Type 2 diabetes
      Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.

      This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.

      * Gestational diabetes
      Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.

      Women who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.

     * Diabetes risk factors
     Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes.

     * Type 1 diabetes
     You’re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you’re a child or teenager, you have a parent or sibling with the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.

     * Type 2 diabetes
     Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you

     are overweight
     are age 45 or older
     have a parent or sibling with the condition
     aren’t physically active
     have had gestational diabetes
     have prediabetes
     have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high triglycerides
     have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Asian American ancestry
     Gestational diabetes
     * Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you

     are overweight
     are over age 25
     had gestational diabetes during a past pregnancy
